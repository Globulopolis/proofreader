2.1.0 - June 14, 2022
Add basic compatibility with Joomla 4:
  - modify SQL:
    - remove default values for text columns;
    - drop unused typo_raw column;
  - replace JResponse with JApplication;
  - add J4-style call for functions adding script and stylesheet;
  - add routing class (not J4-style but enough to make extension work);
  - remove Joomla3-style sidebar and filter in admin if run on Joomla 4, add Joomla4-style searchtools;
  - make "About" page in admin work with Joomla 4.
Fix bugs:
  - remove blank lines at the top and at the bottom of the document if highlight option is active;
  - prevent hidden form fields tags and attributes from being glued so they didn't work;
  - fix a bug with table overflow in admin on Joomla 3.
Add a feature: plugin works in debug mode even if the site if offline (useful for testing and development).
Update metadata.
