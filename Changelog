2.1.0 - May 25, 2022
Add basic compatibility with Joomla 4:
  - modify SQL:
    - remove default values for text columns;
    - drop unused typo_raw column;
  - replace JResponse with JApplication;
  - add J4-style call for functions adding script and stylesheet;
  - add routing class (not J4-style but enough to make extension work).
Fix bugs:
  - remove blank lines at the top and at the bottom of the document if highlight option is active;
  - prevent hidden form fields tags and attributes from being glued so they didn't work.
Update metadata.
